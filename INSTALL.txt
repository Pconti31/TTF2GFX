Install instructions
====================

The needed version of Java is now custom built and distributed with 
the release so you no longer need to deal with its installation.

Download the ttf2gfx-{opsys}-{arch}.{release}.{build}.{zip,tgz} using 
operating system and cpu architecture (ie., win-x64, linux-x64) from github.

Example:

Open a terminal
cd $HOME
tar xvzf ttf2gfx-linux-x64-1.0.tar.gz

Then enter the new TTF2GFX folder
cd TTF2GFX

To run:
./ttf2gfx.sh
