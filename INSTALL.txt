Install instructions
====================

you need to either install Java JRE or use Arduino's IDE 1.87 which ALREADY contains Java 8 JRE

Windows 64-bit
==============

If you are using Arduino IDE's Java skip ahead to Windows Install.

To download Java 8 you must use Oracle's JRE.  No JRE binaries are available from the OpenJDK site.

Oracle's latest version is 192 and the site is:
https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html

You then need to run the downloaded file:
jre-8u192-windows-x64.exe

Windows Install
===============
Download the latest ttf2gfx from github
Then unzip ttf2gfx-win-n.nn.zip in whatever folder is you desire.

If you already have the system environment variable JAVE_HOME set
you can simply run the ttf2gfx.bat file.

If not, edit the ttf2gfx.bat file to point to your java installation.
change line 2 from:
REM set JAVA_HOME="C:\Program Files\Java"
to whatever folder has java installed. For example
set JAVA_HOME="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_192\Java"
or for Arduino's IDE
set JAVA_HOME="C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\java"

Don't forget the quotes.

WINDOWS RUN ttf2gfx
===================
You can now run ttf2gfx using the bat script.
ttf2gfx.bat

LINUX
=====

During installation You simply need to verify a version of java is installed.
ttf2gfx is built using Java 1.8 but should run with the latest code.

from a command window type:
java -version

If that works go LINUX DOWNLOAD ttf2gfx.  

If it turns out no java is installed it will likely inform you of what commands 
to use to install java.

If not, You can download Java JRE by using:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install default-jre

Again verify with:
java -version

LINUX DOWNLOAD ttf2gfx
======================
Download the latest ttf2gfx from github
Then unpack ttf2gfx-linux-n.nn.tar.gz in whatever folder is you desire.
tar xvzf ttf2gfx-linux-n.nn.tar.gz

Again it really doesn't matter what version you are running.
There is no need to edit the ttf2gfx.sh script.

LINUX run the ttf2gfx
=====================
./ttf2gfx.sh

MacOS DOWNLOAD ttf2gfx
======================
Download the latest ttf2gfx from github
Then unzip ttf2gfx-osx-n.nn.zip in whatever folder is you desire.

You should be able to simply double click on the jar file.
